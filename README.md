### Usage as user script
I would recommmend "Firemonkey" as a userscript/css manager, it is very pretty!
To use the script, copy and paste the contents of "gpi.js" for a user script on Google and enjoy° :)

## Legacy notes
Version v1, v2 and v3 are in place for historical reasons."gpi.js" is always the current version.
