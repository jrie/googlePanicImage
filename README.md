# googlePanicImage
Displays direct "view" link, "image size" and "picture sizes" on images at Google Image search.

## Summary
Once GooglePanicImages is enabled, images on Google which are hovered over with the mouse are showing a "View" button to open the image directly, and additional image details like dimensions and byte/kb/mb sizes are shown.

No additional requests to any of the sites is down, the data is.. "provided" ;)

### Usage as user script
I would recommend to use "Firemonkey" as a userscript/css manager, it is very pretty!
To use the script, copy and paste the contents of "gpi.js" for a user script to run at Google and enjoy° :)

## Legacy notes
Version v1, v2 and v3 are in place for historical reasons."gpi.js" is always the current version.
