# googlePanicImage
Displays direct "view" links on images at Google Image search

## Summary
Once GooglePanicImages is enabled, a 'View' button is displayed on top of images from Google Image search, when images are hovered over. Clicking on 'View' opens the source image directly in a new tab.

**Note**:
This works ouf of the box for the initial 100 images found - after that, in reason of a Google encoding for the URLs, you have to click on the image in order to get the "View" link. Also the big preview image can be accessed by clicking on it.
