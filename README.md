# googlePanicImages | googlePanicImage
Displays direct "view" link, "image size" and "picture sizes" on images at Google Image search.

## Screenshot
<img width="1196" height="761" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ef6a4d6-896e-4a49-80ae-944d48a58ac9" />

## Summary
Once GooglePanicImages is enabled, images on Google which are hovered over with the mouse are showing a "View" button to open the image directly, and additional image details like dimensions and byte/kb/mb sizes are shown.

No additional requests to any of the sites is down, the data is.. "provided" ;)


## Download as addon
*Note*: The addon is current only published in "Version 4.x" for Firefox and Chrome - other versions are on the way asap.

The addon can be downloaded here: [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/googlepanicimages/) | [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/googlepanicimages/ofnokbendbpfgbomaepcomeciblhphip) | [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/googlepanicimages/) | [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cllbfapjhkobfdechjnofjbgejdebdgn)

### Usage as user script
I would recommend to use `Firemonkey` - see [here](https://github.com/erosman/firemonkey) as a userscript/css manager, it just works!
To use the script, copy and paste the contents of "gpi.js" for a user script to run at Google and enjoy° :)

## Legacy notes
Version v1, v2 and v3 are in place for historical reasons."gpi.js" is always the current version.
